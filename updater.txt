		"Notes"	"More info @ https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=293218. Changes in 2.5.3:"
		"Notes"	"Added 'TF2Item' methodmap handle version for 'OnItemOverride'."
		"Notes"	"Increased 'MAXMESSAGE' define from 128 to 512."
		"Notes"	"Deprecated old Health system and added fixes to maintain compatibility."
		"Notes"	"Added 'iHealth' property to the VSH2Player methodmap, using 'GetPropInt("iHealth")' still works for backward compatibility but is no longer necessary as using 'GetClientHealth' works as well."
		"Notes"	"Used 'any' type for natives that didn't return an int."
